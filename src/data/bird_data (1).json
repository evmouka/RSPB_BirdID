        "Appearance": "The Dunnock is a small brown and grey bird. Males and females look the same, juveniles are less grey than adults. Beak thinner and more pointed than a House Sparrow\u2019s. Grey chest and head, with a brown crown \u2013 overall, they\u2019re much greyer than House Sparrows. Streaky brown back. Pinkish legs",
        "Habitat": "Common garden birds throughout much of the UK (except Shetland), they\u2019re quite happy living in small gardens, even in cities and suburban areas, but they\u2019re particularly at home in gardens where there are dense shrubs they can nest in, and bird feeders for them to pick up scraps from. You can also see them in woodland and parks, farmland and moorland, except in remote upland areas.",
        "Call": "Dunnocks have a loud, squeaky warbling song, that sounds a bit like someone writing on a whiteboard with a creaky pen. They sing from bushes or high in trees, and you\u2019ll mostly hear them in the first half of the year. Their call is a squeaky \u2018peep\u2019",
        "Behaviour": "They tend to be solitary or seen in pairs, and spend a lot of time skulking around on the ground. Quiet and shy, it's often seen on its own, creeping along the edge of a flower bed or near to a bush, moving in a rather nervous, shuffling way, often flicking its wings as it goes. When two rival males come together they become animated with lots of wing-flicking and loud calling",
        "Fact 1": "Dunnocks are also known as \u2018hedge sparrows\u2019 but they\u2019re not sparrows at all \u2013 they\u2019re actually the only UK member of the bird family called the Accentors. ",
        "Fact 2": "To secure hatching success, Dunnocks copulate most frequently out of all small birds studied, with pairs often mating twice every hour over a 10-day period! ",
        "Fact 3": "The Dunnock is known for its unconventional approach to raising a brood: they\u2019re famously not faithful to their mate. Males will often pair up with multiple females, but more unusually, females are known to partner with two males at the same time to benefit from multiple males provisioning her nest! ",
